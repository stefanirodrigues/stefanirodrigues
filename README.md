- 👋 Hi, I’m Stéfani! I'm a Brazilian ESL teacher and I'm majoring in Languages, Linguistics and Literature. I've always loved technology and tinkering with computers though, so I'm learning how to code. :)
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, mainly web development. I'm also interested in NLP. Outside strictly technology, I love horror stuff, literature and music, especially metal.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some CS fundamentals on CS50x. I've dabbled with C and Python, as well as HTML and CSS. In due time I'll reach Javascript (and more to come).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. If you want my help/wanna help me, feel free to reach out! If you want to talk about shared interests, feel free too!
- 📫 You can e-mail me @ stefanirodrigues@live.com. You can also click on my .carrd link on my profile to find me at other places. :)
